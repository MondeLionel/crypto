A small site to "vue" the top ten cryptocurrencies with price uodates every hour.

See what I did there?

A weekend project to learn Vuejs and Bulma.io as the css framework because who has time to write 400+ lines of CSS for a one page site, AMIRIGHT?
So the basics of Vue, Axios and Bulma all in about two to three hours. Mostly spent debugging my rubbish Javascript as I have no handle on the language.
Feel free to do whatever you want with it. If there's an API for vintage table prices, adult entertainment actress popularity or dog poop consistency, feel at ease to use axios and vue.
